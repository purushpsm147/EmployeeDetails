# EmployeeDetails
This is simple console app in c# written in Visual Studio 2016. The App is developed to get employee details in an Organization and store the details in Generic List and Dictionaries while implementing OOPS Concepts. It's a great way to start your exploration in C#



To Test the console app, simply create a new visual studio solution and copy the content of the class in your visual studio project.

The project will take basic employee details like DOB,DOJ, name ID etc. 

I have added some validations in the project. You can modify the projectas you wish.

Feel free to make some suggestions.
